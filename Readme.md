## The Legend of Zelda 64: The Beta Remade ##

### What is this project? ##

This project is an attempt to recreate the world of the beta of Ocarina of Time based off of available resources.  Since we obviously cannot know everything that was planned, we will improvise where appropriate.

### What is the Ocarina of Time beta? ##

Originally, Nintendo had intended for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to run on the Nintendo 64 DD, which would have allowed them to create a much larger game.  The DD never saw an American release since it didn't sell well in Japan.  As a result, Ocarina of Time for the DD was scrapped and already existing work was ported to the Nintendo 64.  Since the Nintendo 64 was had inferior hardware in comparison to the DD, a lot of the game had to be striped down.

### How do you intend to build this game if it was never released? ###

There is a surprisingly large amount of information on what it was intended to be on the internet.  We intend to use this information in conjunction with our own ideas to rebuild the original Zelda64 beta.

### What do you intend to use to build the game? ###

When we started this project, we were intending to use Microsoft's XNA.  Unfortunately, Microsoft saw it fit to discontinue support for XNA in favor of using DirectX directly.  As a result, we spent a significant amount of time rewriting our XNA stack in Unity3D, which, in the long run will support us much better than XNA could have.

### OK, where is the release? ###

We don't have one yet, but don't worry, we are hard at work on one.  This is done in our free time, so it is slow moving, but we hope to have a release at some point in the future.
